SIMPLE_SHELL TEAM PROJECT

PROJECT DONE 

This project was written with the below 

•	Shell

•	C programming Language

•	Betty liner

REQUIREMENT

•	All files be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the option –wall –werror –wextra-pedantic –std+gnu89

•	All files should end with a new line

•	A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.

•	Use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

•	Shell should not have any memory leaks

•	No more than 5 function per file

•	All header files should be the description of the project

•	Write a README with the description of the project

DESCRIPTION

The simple UNIX command interpreter replicates functionalities of the simple (sh).Additional functions are also included. The program was written in c as a Project for ALX software engineering.

INSTALLATION

We clone the below repository and compile the file into executable using Gcc complier

https://github.com/osalami16/simple_shell.git

Compilation 

It is compile with

Gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -STD=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

•	Print a prompt and waits for a command from the user

•	Create a process in the command will be checked

•	Checks the built-ins, alias in the PATH, and executable programs 

•	When the command is finish, the program returns to the process and print the prompt

•	$ Pwd

•	./simple_shell

•	"welcome to our shell"

•	$ echo "you can use normal linux

•	$



WHAT WE LEARNT FROM THIS PROJECT

•	Collaboration

•	Sharing of coding

•	Understanding each other emotion

•	How shell works and finding programs

•	Working with memory allocation

•	Building a test to check our code
